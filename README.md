# FS2020-OWL-Landmarks
OWL Landmark objects for MS FS 2020

This is my addition to the new FS 2020. I will create several VFR landmarks for use in the simulator. I've started with Benteler Arena in Paderborn, home of SC Paderborn 07, a soccer club in the 2. Bundesliga.

## TODO
* Sch√ºco Arena, Bielefeld
* Wewelsburg
* Hermanns-Denkmal
* etc.


## Installation
Just put the owllandmarks-scene folder into your Community folder and have fun.

This work is non-profit, non-commercial and is not to be used in commercial way. The models are free 3D Warehouse sketchup models, thanks to all the people providing these objects.

This work is powered by coffee. If you like to support me creating more landmarks: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sleepytobi
