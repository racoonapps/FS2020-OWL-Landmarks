# FS2020-OWL-Landmarks
OWL Landmark objects for MS FS 2020

This is my addition to the new FS 2020. I will create several VFR landmarks for use in the simulator. I've started with Benteler Arena in Paderborn, home of SC Paderborn 07, a soccer club in the 2. Bundesliga.

## TODO
* Sch√ºco Arena, Bielefeld
* Wewelsburg
* Hermanns-Denkmal
* etc.


## Installation
Just put the owllandmarks-scene folder into your Community folder and have fun.

This work is powered by coffee. If you like to support me creating more landmarks: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sleepytobi
