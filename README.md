# FS2020-OWL-Landmarks
OWL Landmark objects for MS FS 2020

This is my addition to the new FS 2020. I will create several VFR landmarks for use in the simulator.

## Completed
* Benteler Arena, Paderborn
* Sch√ºco Arena, Bielefeld
* Fernmeldeturm, Bielefeld
* Hermanns-Denkmal, Detmold (needs some texturing rework and lighting)

## Near completion
* Kaiser-Wilhelm Denkmal, Porta Westfalica
* Sparrenburg, Bielefeld


## Installation
Just put the *owllandmarks-scene folder* into your Community folder and have fun.

This work is non-profit, non-commercial and is not to be used in commercial way. The models are free 3D Warehouse sketchup models, thanks to all the people providing these objects.

This work is powered by coffee & beer. If you like to support me creating more landmarks: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sleepytobi or via Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/my/profile
